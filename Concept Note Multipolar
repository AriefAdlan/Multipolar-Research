Reassessing Global Order: Toward a Coherent Architecture of Multipolarity

Background
The contemporary international system is undergoing a profound structural transformation marked by the erosion of unipolar dominance and the consolidation of multiple centers of power. Traditional analytical frameworks rooted in post–Cold War liberal hegemony increasingly fail to explain emerging patterns of global interaction, strategic autonomy, and geopolitical realignment. This condition necessitates a systematic reassessment of global order through the lens of multipolar world architecture.

Problem Statement
While multipolarity is frequently invoked in diplomatic discourse and strategic narratives, it remains conceptually fragmented and analytically underdeveloped. Existing literature often treats multipolarity as a descriptive condition rather than as an organized architecture with identifiable logics, mechanisms, and institutional consequences. The absence of a coherent analytical framework limits both academic understanding and policy formulation in navigating a multipolar environment.

Objectives
This research initiative aims to:

Conceptualize multipolarity as an architectural system rather than a transitional phase.

Identify the structural components, actors, and interaction patterns within a multipolar order.

Assess the implications of multipolar architecture for diplomacy, sovereignty, and global governance.

Provide policy-relevant insights for middle powers navigating strategic positioning in a multipolar system.

Research Questions

What constitutes the structural architecture of a multipolar world order?

How do major and middle powers interact within a non-hierarchical global system?

In what ways does multipolarity reshape diplomatic practice and strategic autonomy?

What opportunities and constraints does multipolarity present for states such as Indonesia?

Methodological Orientation
The research adopts an interdisciplinary approach combining international relations theory, strategic studies, and policy analysis. Methodologically, it integrates qualitative analysis—such as conceptual mapping and discourse analysis—with selective data-driven exploration to support strategic assessment. The orientation remains policy-aware without sacrificing academic rigor.

Expected Contribution
This project seeks to contribute to international relations scholarship by offering a structured framework for understanding multipolarity as a durable global architecture. Practically, it aims to inform policymakers, diplomats, and strategic institutions engaged in navigating an increasingly complex and decentralized international system.

Strategic Relevance
By positioning multipolarity as an architectural condition rather than an anomaly, this research supports more calibrated diplomatic strategies, enhances strategic foresight, and strengthens intellectual sovereignty in global policy discourse.
