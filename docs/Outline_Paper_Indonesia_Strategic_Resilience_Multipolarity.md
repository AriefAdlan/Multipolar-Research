The Influence of the International System on Indonesia’s Strategic Resilience in the Multipolar Era 
II. Conceptualizing Multipolar International Systems

The concept of a multipolar international system refers to a global order in which power is distributed among multiple significant actors rather than concentrated in a single hegemon or divided between two dominant blocs. Unlike unipolar or bipolar systems, multipolarity is characterized by fluid alignments, overlapping spheres of influence, and the absence of a universally accepted hierarchical authority.

In a multipolar system, power should not be understood solely in material terms such as military capabilities or economic size. Instead, it encompasses diplomatic leverage, normative influence, technological capacity, and the ability to shape institutional agendas. Consequently, multipolarity functions less as a fixed balance of power and more as an evolving architecture in which multiple centers of influence coexist, compete, and cooperate simultaneously.

This architectural perspective is critical. Multipolarity is not merely a transitional phase between hegemonic orders but represents a structural condition with its own internal logic. It reshapes patterns of interaction by reducing predictability, increasing strategic ambiguity, and amplifying the role of agency for non-great powers. States are no longer compelled to align rigidly with a dominant pole; instead, they navigate a complex environment of selective partnerships and issue-based cooperation.

Furthermore, multipolar systems tend to produce fragmentation in global governance. International institutions increasingly reflect competing norms and interests, while regional frameworks gain prominence as arenas of influence. This fragmentation challenges universalist models of order and requires states to recalibrate their diplomatic strategies accordingly.

Understanding multipolarity as an international system, therefore, demands an analytical shift from linear power hierarchies to networked and pluralistic structures. This shift is essential for assessing how states—particularly middle powers—operate within, adapt to, and shape a multipolar world.

III. Strategic Resilience as an Analytical Concept

Strategic resilience refers to a state’s capacity to sustain its core interests, adapt to systemic change, and preserve strategic autonomy amid external pressures. In the context of a multipolar international system, resilience becomes a central analytical concept, as states face heightened uncertainty, intensified competition, and fluctuating alignments.

Unlike traditional notions of power that emphasize dominance or deterrence, strategic resilience focuses on endurance and adaptability. It encompasses the ability to absorb shocks, manage strategic risks, and recalibrate policies without compromising sovereignty or long-term national objectives. Strategic resilience is therefore both a structural and an agency-driven concept.

Analytically, strategic resilience can be understood through three interrelated dimensions. First is sovereign resilience, which refers to the protection of decision-making independence against coercive external influence. Second is strategic autonomy, defined as the capacity to pursue national interests through diversified partnerships rather than exclusive alignments. Third is adaptive capacity, which involves institutional flexibility, diplomatic agility, and the ability to respond to systemic transformation.

In a multipolar system, resilience is not achieved through isolation or rigid neutrality. Instead, it emerges from calibrated engagement, strategic hedging, and active participation in multilateral and regional institutions. States enhance resilience by maintaining policy flexibility, leveraging normative and diplomatic capital, and positioning themselves as indispensable actors within multiple strategic networks.

For middle powers, strategic resilience is particularly critical. Their influence does not derive from overwhelming material power, but from their ability to maneuver within systemic constraints. As such, strategic resilience provides a more precise analytical lens than traditional balance-of-power frameworks for assessing state behavior in a multipolar era.

By employing strategic resilience as a core concept, this research moves beyond static assessments of power and toward a dynamic understanding of how states sustain relevance, autonomy, and influence under conditions of systemic complexity.
Policy Implications: Strengthening Indonesia’s Strategic Resilience
The conceptualization of strategic resilience as a state’s capacity for endurance, autonomy, and adaptation carries direct implications for Indonesia’s foreign policy orientation in a multipolar international system. Rather than prioritizing dominance or rigid alignment, Indonesia’s strategic posture should emphasize calibrated engagement and long-term flexibility.

First, Indonesia should institutionalize strategic autonomy through diversified partnerships. In a multipolar environment, resilience is enhanced by avoiding excessive dependence on any single power center. Indonesia’s foreign policy should therefore continue to expand issue-based cooperation across multiple strategic partners while preserving independent decision-making authority.

Second, sovereign resilience must be reinforced through diplomatic consistency and normative positioning. Indonesia’s ability to withstand external pressure depends on the credibility and coherence of its diplomatic narratives, particularly regarding sovereignty, non-alignment, and international law. Clear articulation of these principles strengthens Indonesia’s bargaining position in global and regional forums.

Third, Indonesia should prioritize adaptive diplomacy as a core policy instrument. Strategic resilience requires institutional flexibility, rapid policy recalibration, and diplomatic agility. This includes empowering diplomatic missions, enhancing strategic foresight capabilities, and integrating geopolitical risk assessment into foreign policy planning.

Fourth, multilateral and regional engagement should be leveraged as resilience multipliers. Active participation in ASEAN, the G20, and other multilateral frameworks enables Indonesia to distribute strategic risk, amplify diplomatic influence, and mitigate systemic uncertainty inherent in multipolar competition.

Finally, strategic resilience should be embedded as a long-term policy framework rather than a reactive posture. This entails aligning foreign policy planning, defense diplomacy, and economic statecraft under a coherent strategic vision that recognizes multipolarity as a durable condition of the international system.
